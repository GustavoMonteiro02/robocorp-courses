# robocorp-courses
This repository contains my solutions for all automation courses provided by Robocorp. The courses have three certification levels, each represented by a dedicated branch in this repoâ€”feel free to explore!

Disclaimer: While this codebase has room for optimization in areas like logging, exception handling, and object-oriented design, I've intentionally kept it simple to prioritize learning from the courses. These robots are not designed for production use.
